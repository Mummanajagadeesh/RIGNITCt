* **Each folder contains its own `index.html`**.
* **`bs/`** is for testing small features, experimental code, or transitions.
* **`assets/`** contains CSS and image assets, organized by purpose.

## Current Status

* **Main Page:** Done

* **Contact Page:** Done

  * Update social/contact links.
  * Form uses Formspree ID.
  * Can directly provide a URL with pre-filled fields in the form

* **Activities** Main priority now

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Companies

* Add images to `assets/images/companies/`.
* Update the main page HTML to reference these images.
* Avoid hardcoding paths multiple times; keep it consistent.

### Projects Management

* Maintain `.json` files neatly.
* Ensure new projs are added consistently.

### UI/UX Guidelines

* Navbar CSS is located in `assets/css/navbar.css`.
* Improve UI where needed; remove anything that feels “cringe”.
* Maintain consistency with colors and layout, especially for spline scenes.
* Hidden watermarks have been masked with background colors—avoid disturbing this.

## Notes

* All images are in `assets/images/`; refer only to these paths.
* Small experiments, UI prototypes, and feature tests should go in `bs/`.
* Keep the repository modular and maintainable.

## Future Work

* Improve the main page.
* Add more company logos and gallery photos.
* Complete the Activities page.
* Keep all `.json` files modular and easy to update.
* Optimize page loading speed.
* **Enhance mobile optimization:** make the layout and elements (like navbar and closing buttons) fully responsive on all devices.
* Improve meta tags for SEO.
* Maintain a black-and-white theme only and improve the overall UI.
* Ensure accessibility: provide proper alt text for images, maintain sufficient contrast, and use semantic HTML.
