## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Companies

- Add images to `/assets/images/companies/`.
- Update the main page HTML to reference these images.
- Avoid hardcoding paths multiple times; keep it consistent.

### Projects Management

- Maintain `.json` files in `src/data` neatly.
- Ensure new projs are added consistently.

### UI/UX Guidelines

- Improve UI where needed; remove anything that feels “cringe”.
- Maintain consistency with colors and layout, especially for spline scenes.
- Hidden watermarks have been masked with background colors—avoid disturbing this.

---

## Notes

- All images are in `/assets/images/`; refer only to these paths.
- Small experiments, UI prototypes, and feature tests should go in `test/`.
- Keep the repository modular and maintainable.

## Future Work

- Improve the main page.
- Add more company logos and gallery photos.
- Complete the Activities page.
- Keep all `.json` files modular and easy to update.
- Optimize page loading speed.
- Improve meta tags for SEO.
- Maintain a black-and-white theme only and improve the overall UI.
- Ensure accessibility: provide proper alt text for images, maintain sufficient contrast, and use semantic HTML.
- Delete all pngs and jpgs, switch to webp.
- Try cleaning up the CSS to make it minimal
- Find better font, make it consistent site-wide.
